## v0.9.0-glacier - 2023-01-08

- Fork of `Gleeunit` 0.9.0:
  - This is a fork of [*Gleeunit*](https://hex.pm/packages/gleeunit) that allows it to
    be called as a library/function with a list of test modules instead of
    just via CLI.
  - This fork is being used primarily as a test runner target by
    <https://hex.pm/packages/glacier>.
  - I will attempt to keep this in sync with `lpil/gleeunit`.
